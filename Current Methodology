Developer Interest

This gauge uses bitcoin as a benchmark.
The developer work for bitcoin is the standard and defines a 100% score. 
Importantly, 100% is not a limit in any way, and any cryptocurrency could score higher than 100%. 
The most useful way to think of this is the relationship between water and celsius. 
The freezing and boiling points of water were chosen to be 0-100 degrees which made it easy to create equal degrees of centigrade. 
Of course, there are temperatures below 0 and above 100 and we expect to see the same with this measurement over time.
