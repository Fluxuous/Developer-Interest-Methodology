Developer Interest

First, we use a benchmark system where the developer work for bitcoin is the standard and defines a 100% score. Importantly, 100% is not a limit in any way, and any cryptocurrency could score higher than 100%. The most useful way to think of this is the relationship between water and celsius. The freezing and boiling points of water were chosen to be 0-100 degrees which made it easy to create equal degrees of centigrade. Of course, there are temperatures below 0 and above 100 and we expect to see the same with these score over time.

The following is the breakdown of data points and weights that are used to measure developer interest in a cryptocurrency:

GitHub Watchers
Weight: 20%
Source: GitHub

GitHub Contributors
Weight: 20%
Source: GitHub
This metric measures the level of activity from the developer community; a higher number indicates more interests in a project, as anyone can contribute changes to a project for review.

GitHub Stars 
Weight: 20%
Source: Github
The number of stars GitHub users have given a code repository. This metric measures how popular a project is because stars are given to indicate that users like the project or save them as bookmarks so they can follow the progress of the project.

GitHub Forks
Weight: 10%
Source: GitHub
The number of times GitHub users have copied another user’s public code repository to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. This metric measures the level of interest from developer community, as forks are commonly used to propose change to someone else’s project or starting point for an idea.

GitHub Merged Pull Requests
Weight: 10%
Source: GitHub
The number of changes submitted by another user that have been merged in the main repository by a core developer in the project. This metric measures active project development and contributions from the developer community.

GitHub Open Issues
Weight: 5%
Source: GitHub
The number of open issues or tasks that are a work in progress. This metric is an indicator of on-going project development and progress.

GitHub Closed Issues
Weight: 5%
Source: GitHub
The number of issues reported and resolved, and tasks completed. This metric is an indicator of on-going project development and progress.

GitHub New Commits
Weight: 10%
Source: GitHub
The number of new commits or “revision” to a file in a repository, which enables tracking changes that were made and by who. This metric indicates on-going development activity and progress.
