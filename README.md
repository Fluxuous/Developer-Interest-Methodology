# Developer-Interest-Methodology
Coindesk aims to create a tool that can measure interest and activity in cryptocurrencies.
This is done by measuring the forces that shape the growth of decentralized networks (ie. we seek to measure cryptoeconomics).
Perhaps the most important force to create a succesful decentralized cryptocurrency is through capturing the interest of developers to contribute to the project.
Because this is so vital, yet so complex, the goal for this repo is to capture insight from the development community to help harden our methodology.
